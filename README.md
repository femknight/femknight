- 👋 Hi, I’m @femknight V Em
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all the things. Did an economics undergrad a million years ago, then a sociology MA and started a sociology PHD which confirmed I needed to learn how to code (data; data everywhere).
- 🌱 I’m currently working in Vue.js, Python, Coldfusion.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have to do with democratizing knowledge production.
- 📫 you can email me here: emiliefiliondonato.1@gmail.com
